					<h1>Experiential Learning Visualizations</h1>
					<p>Role: Product Design, Data Vis, Development</p>
					{/* <p>
						As a part of the Design & Social Interaction Studio at Georgia Tech,
						I design and develop interactive visualizations to help students
						gain an experiential and intuitive understanding of quantum
						mechanics and semiconductor physics principles. The tools used to
						build them include Figma, p5.JS, D3.js, and GSAP.
					</p> */}
					<h2>Context</h2>
					<p>
						LearnQM is a project by the Design and Social Interaction Studio at
						Georgia Tech. It aims to provide educational tools to help students
						gain experiential knowledge and intuition around the core quantum
						physics concepts behind semiconductors.{" "}
					</p>
					<h2>Problem</h2>
					<p>
						Quantum Mechanics (QM) and Semiconductor Physics are the foundations
						taught in core science and engineering courses. Educators face major
						challenges because of the abstract, non-experiential, and
						counter-intuitive nature of the key concepts in these areas. Course
						materials predominantly emphasize mathematical formulations rather
						than conceptual understanding. As a result, students often struggle
						to develop robust mental models and intuitive grasp of the concepts.
					</p>
					<h2>Objective</h2>
					<p>
						Create interactive visualizations that teach complex concepts in an
						intuitive way to help students gain intuition and develop accurate
						mental (visual) models.

					<h2>Research</h2>
					<p>
						User flow maps and personas were created to empathize with users and
						their mindsets and pain-points during the whole process of
						interaction with the product.

					<h2>Design</h2>

					<p>Conceptualizing the designs involved:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>sketching designs</li>
						<li>making prototypes of the interactions</li>
						<li>conducting guerrilla user testing of the visualizations</li>
						<li>iteration through both design and development</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Insights from user testing</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Colors play a big role in grouping conceptual groups.</li>
						<li>
							People can get overwhelemed when presented too much information
							and call to action at once.
						</li>
						<li>
							People get more reward out of figuring out information rather than
							being directly told.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Design Considerations</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Make sure colors are accessible to visually impaired and does not
							detract from understanding the visualizations.'
						</li>
						<li>
							Limit the amount of information and possible interaction
							introduced per scene.
						</li>
						<li>
							Encourage users to experiment with visualizations to develop their
							own understanding.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>
						Through this project, Iâ€™ve come to realize the importance of UX in
						all kinds of domains, especially education. Through applying user
						research, we can actually see where students are struggling and find
						solutions that help them to learn in more holistic and intuitive
						ways.
