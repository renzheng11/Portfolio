          <h2>Task</h2>
          <p>
            The challenge of this project was to collect personal data from
            day-to-day life and visualize it in some way. This data could be on
            any aspect of daily life and needed to include multiple variables.
            Using these records, we were tasked with creating a visualized “self
            portrait”.

          <h2>Data Collection</h2>
          <p>
            Before choosing a specific topic to focus on, I decided to collect
            records from several disparate areas of my life to see what
            unexpected patterns might arise. This included data on exercise,
            sleep, screen time, time I spent on hobbies like cooking and biking,
            as well as an overall numerical rating for the day. Most of these
            numbers were collected from my calendar which keeps track of how I
            spend my time throughout the day. Lastly, I wrote down one memorable
            moment from each day, whether good or bad. This process was carried
            on over an entire month.
          </p>

          <h2>Research + Experimentation</h2>
          <p>
            I searched for a way to bring more story-telling to this data self
            portrait. As I looked back over the data collected, I realized that
            most of my favorite moments recorded from each day were related to
            my friends. So that sparked the question: what if I just show the
            time I spent with my favorite people?
            <br /><br />
            Pivoting directions meant going back to the drawing board to
            generate new ways of representing the data that I had. Using design
            books as well as online resources, I tried finding inspiration for
            novel ways of visualization that I have not yet experimented with. I
            was especially influenced by the book Dear Data by Giorgia Lupi and
            Stefanie Posavec and the generous honesty of their visualizations of
            daily life.

            While on a break away from this project, I stumbled upon an image a
            device used for charting temperature and humidity. Enamored by the
            chart’s aesthetic pattern and its potential for data visualization,
            I decided to use it as the base for my self portrait.

            This draft came out rather spontaneously as I played with the
            limitation of using the base graph. I split the ellipse into six
            pieces, each representing a friend with each round row as a unit for
            one day. I drew from the original data to record the time I spent
            with people each day and the activity, as well as including the good
            / bad moments as written snippets. I wanted to move away from simply
            showing time as numerical, so I tried using paint to represent
            emotions that surround each time snippet.
          </p>

          <p>
            Through this experimentation, I began to think of this graph as a
            representation of my memories. The inside of the circle starts on
            the first day of the month (when I started recording the data) and
            it expands outward to the end of the month. This pattern contributed
            to the meaning of the piece as days farther away from the present
            start to fade in memory and invoke a sense of the cyclical nature of
            our days.

          <h2>Refinement</h2>
          <p>
            From critiques, it was clear that the mission at this point in the
            process was finding how to present the portrait to an audience and
            the considering the various questions that brings:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              What information methods should be used to convey the data
              (legends, pointers ...)?
            </li>
            <li>
              What forms of print media would best communciate the content
              (poster, booklet ...) ?
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Using sketching and rough paper prototypes, I experimented with
            different ways of representation: exploring ways of segmenting,
            layering, zooming in, drawing attention to...
          </p>
          <img
            src="Assets/portrait/portrait_sketch3.png"
            alt=""
            class="page_pic pic-adj"
          />
          <p>
            In the end, I decided to follow advice from critiques of keeping
            focus on the poster itself and letting the audience linger on it,
            exploring it on their own terms.
